## Project Objectives

1. Identify employees' working preferences, whether it is work from home or a hybrid model.
2. Monitor employees' most available days for planning meetings and important events.
3. Track employee sick leave to help the organization take precautions against the spread of epidemic diseases.
4. Assist stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding productivity and operational cost management.

## Datasets

This project includes both raw and transposed datasets. The raw data required cleaning and transposing, which was accomplished using Power Query Editor.

## Key Steps

To format the raw data, the following steps were performed in Power Query Editor:
1. Duplicated the original data and transposed/unpivoted one sheet.
2. Used the modified transposed data as a template to apply changes to other sheets.
3. Created a parameter for the sheet name or number.
4. Invoked a custom function by passing the created parameter.
5. Loaded and applied changes to the other sheets. After cross-checking the data, visualization commenced.

## Final Dashboard Results

**Work-from-Home Trends:** 13% of employees work from home on weekends to maintain work-life balance. This information can guide management decisions on operational costs and productivity.

**Employee Availability:** Over 90% of employees are available on Mondays and Tuesdays, allowing the organization to plan important events, client meetings, and project planning on these days.

**Sick Leave Analysis:** With a sick leave percentage of less than 2%, it indicates a positive impact on employees' health and well-being, emphasizing the company's commitment to employee wellness and effective work management.
